## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

I learned a lot with this project, at first sight it seamed to be easy for me, but walking through out the project I found very challenged stuff like the toggle for themes among others. It took me a while to develop every detail of the style and appearence as well as the behavior, but finally I think that the result is the one desired and I am happy with it. 

### Continued development

There are always many things to improve and I hope to continue working on this project to realease better versions.

I want to specially improve in the toggle behavior to have a bunch of themes which users can select according to their preferences.
